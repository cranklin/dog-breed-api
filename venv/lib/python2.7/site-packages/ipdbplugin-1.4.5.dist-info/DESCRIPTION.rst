What about running nose with a smarter interactive debugger?

Use this and *never* risk yourself forgetting `import ipdb; ipdb.set_trace()` in your code again!

This plugin is 99.99% based on nose's builtin debug plugin.

If you have any ideas about how to improve it, come and fork the code at http://github.com/flavioamieiro/nose-ipdb
